There are three classes, each with different algorithms

class 1 is OpenCv knn

class 2 is OpenCv knn but with different algorithm

class 3 is sklearn with knn 

class 3 It does not predict well

but class 2 or 1 It does predict well 

0 to 7 can predict well

if your resolution is 1370 * 720 its work 


good luck
